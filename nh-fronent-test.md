# nata.house frontend test
###### v2.1

Congratulations! You've made it to the third and final step of our recruitment process. This means we like you! Now it's time for us to see you get your hands dirty writing some code.

We don't mind giving you the cheat sheet. Here's what we're looking for:
* Best coding practices
* Coding style choices, but we promise not to judge if you use tabs
* Low-complexity, highly functional methods

What we're not looking for:
* Bells and whistles
* Reinventing the wheel; external libraries and frameworks are encouraged

Basically, don't overthink it. Don't try to go beyond the scope. Focus on architecting a good solution.

## Introduction
A kanban board, from the kanban methodology, is widely used in Scrum for tracking tasks and their current state. A very simple kanban board consists of three columns, "To do", "Doing" and "Done". Cards are included in the first column, and moved along as people work on the tasks.

## Test
Implement a kanban board using only client-side JavaScript. You should be able to add new tasks, and move existing tasks to other columns.

### Recommendations
* Use a declarative, component-based user interface library like React or Vue. Bonus points if you use something you haven't worked with before, like [Choo](https://github.com/choojs/choo), but it's really up to you!
* Don't spend much time styling or making your app look nice
* Don't worry about features like drag and drop or persisting data
* Use Google as you normally do, just don't copy and paste code!
